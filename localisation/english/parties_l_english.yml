 ancom_desc:0 "Anarcho-communism is a political ideology and social movement that advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, and private property, aiming to establish a society based on voluntary associations, mutual aid, and common ownership of the means of production. \n\nIn anarcho-communism, individuals would organize themselves into decentralized, self-governing communities where decision-making is done through direct democracy or consensus-based processes. Goods and services would be produced and distributed according to the principle of \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need,\" meaning that resources would be shared freely and equitably among all members of society. \n\nAnarcho-communism rejects hierarchical structures and coercion, emphasizing personal autonomy, cooperation, and solidarity. It envisions a stateless, classless society where social relations are based on cooperation and mutual aid rather than competition and exploitation."

It emphasizes the importance of a strong centralized state, led by a single party, to direct the transition to socialism and defend the gains of the revolution against external and internal threats.\n\nMarxism-Leninism also emphasizes the need for international solidarity among socialist and communist parties around the world, with the goal of overthrowing the capitalist system and building a socialist world order."

It was developed by the National Socialist German Workers' Party, also known as the Nazi Party, and led by Adolf Hitler.\n\nNational Socialism is a form of totalitarianism that emphasizes nationalism, racial purity, and authoritarianism. It combines elements of socialism with extreme nationalism and anti-Semitism. It advocates for a one-party state, with the party being controlled by a single leader, and the suppression of individual rights and freedoms in the name of the common good.\n\nThe key tenets of National Socialism include the belief in the superiority of the Aryan race, which is seen as the master race, and the inferiority of other races, particularly Jews. It also promotes the idea of Lebensraum, or living space, for the German people, which is achieved through territorial expansion and conquest."
